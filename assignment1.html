<h2> Working hard </h2>

<div>
<p> <em> Every day is an opportunity to make your life the way you want it to be. Anything is possible when you work toward it, one day at a time. Skip a day, and you lose momentum. Try to do it all at once, and you burn out. Steadily, consistently work, making every day count, you will reach your goals.Today is a chance to grow - to do a little bit more than you did yesterday, a little bit better. a little bit more effectively. Anyone can do a little more, learn a little more, and grow a little more each day. Soon, with consistent effort, those "little bits" add up to major accomplishments. Is there a new customer you want to land? Today is the day to start making it happen. Do you need to lose weight? Today is the day to start doing it. Not next Monday or next month - today. You deserve to reach your goals as soon as possible. Control today and you control your life </em> </p>

<h3> Snowflakes </h3>

<div>
<p> <strong> What I mean is that even when you think you are not good at something, you can still plunge into it wholeheartedly and stick to it. Actually, sometimes you plunge into something <em>because</em> you're not good at it. This is a wonderful feature of the growth mindset. You don't have to think you're already great at something  to want to do it and enjoy doing it. Snowflakes are actually the prefect metaphor for people. Each one is unique, but we all have the same structure and are pretty similar in spite our differences. And really, with as many around as there is, no one is going to notice your differences unless they care enough to look closely. </strong> </p>
